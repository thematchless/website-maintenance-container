# website-maintenance-container

The idea of this `website-maintenance-container` is to have a fairly simple website that will display a friendly maintenance message whenever you update your services.

To customize the displayed texts, you only have to change the text strings inside the [info.json](https://github.com/thematchless/website-maintenance-container/blob/main/src/info.json) file.

```json
{
  "headline": "Website maintenance",
  "description": "We are back in a couple of minutes.",
  "favicon_url": "https://oflisback.github.io/react-favicon/img/github.ico"
}
```
